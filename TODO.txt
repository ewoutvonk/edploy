- auto choice of framework based on investigation (i.e. checking Gemfile for deps: mysql2 gem, rails gem, etc)
- use generators for generating deployment-tasks scripts
- auto load of extensions by capistrano, much like bundler ? ($AUTO_LOAD_CAP_EXTENSIONS which gets extended by extensions themselves, possibly a $NO_AUTO_LOAD_CAP_EXTENSIONS which can be set by the user somewhere to prevent loading of certain extensions)
- checking whether a file is being loaded by capistrano or something else (something like $CAPISTRANO_IS_LOADING boolean)
